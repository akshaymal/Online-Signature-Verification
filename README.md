# Topic : Online Signature Verification on Mobile Devices using Machine Learning

This project deals with the process of signature verification by training the system with instances of a user's genuine and forgery signatures. Dynamic features of an online signature are extracted and used for training purposes. The project also comes along with an Android Application that acts as a cheap medium to gain information about an signature. Features associated with a signature are extracted using the Android Application and are then sent for pre-processing and feature extraction. 

Classifiers used - Support Vector Machine and Artifical Neural Networks
Each user was trained with an individual classifier and optimal results were used using kernal trick and grid search.
